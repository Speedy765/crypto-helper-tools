          <p>Used the address found on most pages, LTC is used because the transaction fees are pretty low compared to BTC. If you would like to donate spending most of your money on  fees is a bit crazy. Still want to use a different currency just let me know.</p>

          <p>Listing a price per second in real-time! gives you the opportunity to see what is really going on. The information on Bittrex listed in the candlestick charts is delayed and sometimes not accurate. It has happened that a buy or sell order was executed while in the charts a CryptoCurrency never hit the exact number. This happens because the candlestick chart's interval can only be set to a minute as the shortest time interval, never ever really displaying the maximum or minimum price of the CryptoCurrency at that time.</p>
