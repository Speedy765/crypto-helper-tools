                <h4 style="text-align:center">How can I donate</h4>
                <p>Used the address found on most pages, LTC is the coin because the transaction fees are pretty low compared to BTC. If you would like to donate $25 spending $10 on fees is a bit crazy. Still want to use a different currency just let me know.</p>

                <h4 style="text-align:center">Why do you list a price per second?</h4>
                <p>Listing a price per second in real-time! gives you the opportunity to see what is really going on. The information on Bittrex listed in the candlestick charts is delayed and sometimes not accurate. It has happened that a buy or sell order was executed while in the charts a CryptoCurrency never hit the exact number. This happens because the candlestick chart's interval can only be set to a minute as the shortest time interval, never ever really displaying the maximum or minimum price of the CryptoCurrency at that time.</p>
