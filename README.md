## What is it
An opensource website for tracking cryptocurreny on Bittrex, Binance and Cryptopia.
Since they lack:
- Realtime support of prices and volumes
- Daily overview with custom time intervals

I decided to make some nice graphs for myself and the tweakers community and others interested.

## Production
http://www.cryptotracky.com

### Todo
- Better readme :-) :-)
- Lots of stuff, add new exchanges, improve
